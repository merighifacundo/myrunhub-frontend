# MyRunHub (Frontend)

This is an open source project, in order to connect several fitness and health tracking applications together and having the ability to join data.

The intention is that the final user can own the data and see across many platforms.

Some examples are:
- You started tracking your runs with Runtastic and then swiched to Runkeeper or Strava. There is no way to agreggate nowadays this open source project will have connectors for all of those.
